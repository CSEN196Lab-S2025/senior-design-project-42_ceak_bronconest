Graham (Alpha RLC),"Not the most social dorm, but the people, location, and staff are amazing. Wouldn't want to live anywhere else!",10,10,10,10,9,9,6
Casa Italiana (da Vinci RLC),"Overall, I enjoyed living at Casa. Although it was a little far from my classes, the peace/silence was worth it- especially at night. We had some issues with water/plumbing at the beginning of the year which took a while to resolve with housing but it wasn't terrible in the end.",3,10,10,10,10,9,8
Graham (Alpha RLC),"Overall was a good dorm with huge rooms and quick access to everywhere on campus. The one thing was that the dorm was super quiet, like I never saw anyone in the lounges or kitchen.",10,9,10,9,9,8,2
Nobili (Unity RLC),"Definitely the largest and nicest dorms on campus. But they are a little more pricey, a little old, and was super quiet but if your whole friend group is able to get the rooms, it's worth it.",4,9,10,10,8,5,1
Sobrato (Loyola RLC),goated,8,9,9,9,9,8,8
Sanfilippo (Magis RLC),"social building, however long walk to middle of campus. rooms were very spacious but there was no air conditioning. would recommend getting air conditioning.",4,5,8,6,8,8,9
Dunne (Modern Perspectives RLC),"nice building, hotel-like, very social, good size rooms, no improvements i can think of",8,7,7,9,9,8,9
Graham (Alpha RLC),The laundry room is nasty.,10,9,4,8,9,2,5
Finn (Cura RLC),"It's pretty chill and quiet because everyone is in there rooms, but the rooms are nice so that makes sense.",7,9,9,8,8,9,6
Sobrato (Loyola RLC),"Front Building:
- The doubles are the smallest on campus.
- They make you have bunk beds and only will lower 1 out of the 2 beds.
- There is only 1 water fountain to use besides water in the dorms.
- The only public bathrooms are on the first floor.
- The front and back building aren't connected, so you have to walk outside to get to the back building.
- There is only 1 laundry room with 4 washers and 4 dryers.
- The dryers never fully dry the clothes.
- The public bathroom seats are weirdly low and half the time theres stuff in the toilets.
- The AC doesn't work sometimes.
- People are loud when walking outside.
- The chairs hurt when you sit in them for more than an hour.
- They put the desks under the beds so you hit your head on the bed frame when using it.
- There's at least 3 locks before getting to your room.
- The random roommate selection sucks.
- The accessibility is only one way where you can hit a button inside going out, but there is no button outside to go in.
- The one door in the building that automatically opens once you buzz it also has an alarm attached to it.",8,9,8,9,9,6,6
Nobili (Unity RLC),The rooms are big and each have their own bathroom which is nice. The ceiling lights are bright like a hospital so it�s good to lamps or other lighting. ,7,7,7,9,8,9,6
Sobrato (Loyola RLC),"Back Building
- If you are on the first floor it is less safe. There is only 2 locks instead of 3 to protect you.
- The most convenient back gate doesn't have a buzzer BUT it's propped open often making things less safe.
- You have to buzz to get into the lobby even though if you're already in the courtyard you had to buzz once so it is weirdly redundant.
- Every convient door to enter from the back building is an emergency exit.
- The dryers are worse in the back building.
- The AC makes weird noise. 
- Leaves are always in the first floor hallways.
- There is a random patio that you will get locked onto and have to jump over bushes to escape.
- Finn blocks any sunlight that can hit the lower floors making everything dark.
- There have been squeaky pipes.
- The showers are sometimes cold.
- There is no good place to watch movies with people.
- The study rooms in the back building smell bad and the piano is hidden away.
- Most of the desks people are nice.
- There is no privacy on the first floor since people can walk by and see you.
- The higher floors also dont have privacy if they face the courtyard since people can see you changing.
- The most privacy is the higher floors on the front building because of the trees.
- There is only 1 elevator for the back building even though there's 4 floors and people use it often to throw out the trash.
- They could use trash shoots to make it easier.
- It takes forever for facilities to fix anything.",7,8,9,7,6,4,7
Finn (Cura RLC),"It looks fancy but then you realize it's weird having a study area right outside of the rooms.

People hang out right outside your door or you study like a zoo animal in a glass area while everyone who enters or exits their rooms sees you.

There is a kitchen on every floor and the fridges start to smell weird. The common rooms where the kitchens are are nice and are different colors, but theres too many study spaces within the wings.

The rooms are nice and large. The bathroom doors make noise but it can be helpful to know if someone is using it.

The AC would either blast cold air for hours and not turn off or not turn on when it was 80 in the room.

Even on the first floor there is more privacy since it is elevated.

Very convient for going to Safeway but is a further walk to anything on campus.

Most of the side doors are stuck and dont work well.

The dryers are so hot they melted my stuffed animal once. So they work well as long as everything rotates properly. They go for 1.5 hours but easily work after 1 hour.",7,9,7,9,8,9,5
Casa Italiana (da Vinci RLC),"Not very social dorm, but loved my roommates, having non-communal bathrooms, and the 8 person suite style.",7,9,9,8,9,7,5
Dunne (Modern Perspectives RLC),"Dunne amenities overall were very nice, but they could improve on overall maintenance of the tech and building (elevator, door locks, etc). Bathrooms were clean mostly but the kitchen and laundry were pretty gross",7,6,6,6,6,6,4
Sanfilippo (Magis RLC),"Flipp is the most affordable housing option, but it�s still relatively spacious and includes your own sink, which is a nice perk. The major downside is the cost of dorming overall. We�re required to pay $2,000 for dining points, but I never use the full amount. I usually end up spending it on other people, which makes it feel like a huge waste of money that could be better used elsewhere. For what it is, the dorm is overpriced, and they charge quite a bit. The showers often have clogged drains, hair everywhere, and the bathrooms tend to smell. On top of that, our dorm community doesn�t really do much to help us connect with each other or the people on our floor. There aren�t many efforts to build friendships or create a social environment. Overall, it�s not a terrible dorm, but there are definitely some significant downsides.",6,4,8,4,4,2,1
McLaughlin-Walsh (Unity RLC),McLaughlin-Walsh is an awesome dorm experience. I had the fortunate opportunity to live in two of 300 rooms that are suites in McLaughlin-Walsh. This was a best of both worlds living quarter that combined both the great social atmosphere and peace and quiet.,8,7,9,10,10,6,9
Nobili (Unity RLC),Awesome dorm with awesome dorm parties. Hot neighbor down the hall ??!,10,7,10,9,10,9,10
Casa Italiana (da Vinci RLC),"Pretty good, mainly high quality except the lack of air conditionings",6,9,6,7,8,6,5
McLaughlin-Walsh (Unity RLC),"Fine dorm, sucked no ac, roommate was horrible but not dorms fault, the bathrooms were always good",8,9,5,6,4,8,10
Casa Italiana (da Vinci RLC),"Moved out within two months, small, no A/C, heater was very loud outside my window, we had no kitchen, the bathrooms were dirty, casa has no social life and is out of the way from main campus, the patio and bocce ball were mid",3,3,3,3,10,5,2
Sanfilippo (Magis RLC),"Loved flip, great people, great location, loved the vaulted ceilings, but the heater was always on so it was hot. I liked the communal bathrooms cuz they didn�t need to be cleaned by me.",8,8,6,8,6,8,8
McLaughlin-Walsh (Unity RLC),"McWalsh is a pretty chill community and conveniently right next to benson and the frats. Doesn't get tons of frat noise being in the back, but also looses out on a lot of the social from the more active dorms. Bathrooms were always OK, kitchens were dirty, and common rooms were nice but small.",8,7,7,7,9,4,4
Campisi (Magis RLC),"Campisi is one of the lowest tier dorms in my opinion. It lacks most of the friendliness of the social dorms but isn't quiet enough to be peaceful. The common rooms are just out in the open and the kitchens are super super cramped. Nice renovated basement good for doing homework or movie nights. Just no privacy at all if your in a single and there aren't any smaller study rooms to go to. The elevator was constantly broken and the only laundry area is in the basement. Also the bathrooms were rather nasty, common areas were also gross as people never cleaned up after themselves.",6,2,7,3,7,4,2
Sobrato (Loyola RLC),"The sobrato apartments are super nice and very peaceful. The single room and shared common area with just your suitemates is game changing. Plus having the courtyard is nice too. Only thing is you have to do all your own cleaning of the bathroom and kitchen but I think its way better than sharing with a whole floor. Close to safeway and lets you have more control over your own food with the kitchen. Also small laundry rooms. Great if your looking for a peaceful home experience, not so great if your looking to make a lot of friends outside of your suite.",8,9,10,10,9,7,3
Campisi (Magis RLC),"Weird smell, always pee on the floor of the bathrooms, crazy roommate. Maybe make sure that the roommates are actually compatible before making them live together.",10,3,2,6,5,3,2
Graham (Alpha RLC),"Graham is the most central dorm in terms of location to benson, the library, and malley. It is a great dorm . In terms of common area cleanliness, there are facility staff who vacuum and take out the trash regularly. People still leave trash in the hallways, although it depends on what wing you live in. We also have to clean our own bathrooms and rooms. Graham is a fairly quiet dorm, but depending on the people who live around you it could be different. I have a neighboring room that blasts music to the point I can feel the bass while laying in bed, so that definitely contributes. Since it is pretty quiet, there isn't much socialization. There are CF/hall events but mostly freshman show up to those. Graham also has pretty large rooms, so it is quite comfortable. It is also pretty safe with the wings requiring scanning in, but last year there was an instance where someone was followed to their room by a stalker using the stairs. The amenities are also quite nice with each wing having a common lounge area, laundry, and a kitchen.",9,7,6,10,8,8,4
Villas,The dishwasher and in unit laundry was nice. My roommates and neighbors are all very respectful and the villas have a calm environment,8,8,9,6,8,5,5
Graham (Alpha RLC),Great,5,7,8,6,8,7,4
Finn (Cura RLC),"Overall I have really enjoyed Finn. It is one of the newer buildings so there aren�t as many issues with it. Although the front door breaks quite often, the water heater has shut down before and there was a bit of an ant infestation. In comparison to other dorms I have visited and heard of what has occurred there, Finn is what I would consider the best. Overall the rooms are quite big and all the amenities work normally. It is definitely a more quiet environment but there are opportunities to be social especially with the events run by cfs and others. The study rooms are also really nice and good for studying, watching movies or just hanging out with friends. The internet tends to decrease though in the public spaces and the study rooms. I have been at Finn for 2 years and have had an overall positive experience.",4,8,8,8,9,8,6
Graham (Alpha RLC),"Excellent, residence life staff were very engaged, position of the dorm was great, the suite style rooms were very substantial. The only complaint I can think of was the quality of the washing machine/dryers as they didn't work that well requiring multiple loads.",10,10,10,8,10,8,9
Finn (Cura RLC),"Very well established dorm with good community events, very open spaces, and gives a modern take on the classic college dorm. Most amenities are great but kitchens are rather lacking when it comes to cooking",7,10,8,10,10,7,10
McLaughlin-Walsh (Unity RLC),"It was pretty solid, very quiet and didn't bump into people that often, rarely ever saw anyone. I liked this so I could have my social element outside of the dorms, and be able to sleep peacefully at night. Amenities were pretty okay, microwave would break like everyweek, but besides that it was okay.",10,7,10,6,8,6,8
Swig (Cyphi RLC),"Swig's benefits include the social aspect and easily accessible common rooms (although they're just empty dorm rooms), but it does lack slightly in safety and quietness.",8,6,3,6,6,7,9
Casa Italiana (da Vinci RLC),"I have really enjoyed staying in Casa this year. The only negative things that I can think of are that some of our neighbors/people above us can be loud, and there is an ant problem. Besides that, I have loved living in Casa.",6,10,4,9,9,7,7
Finn (Cura RLC),My room is nice but my roommates and suitemates aren't mature enough to clean it so it ends up dirty because I'm the only one cleaning it and I can't afford to do it often.,8,4,9,10,6,8,6
Graham (Alpha RLC),"It was spacious and had lots of space. We had our own private bathroom with a communal laundry mat, kitchen, and communal space. Occasionally the water heater wouldn't work and the a/c was finicky but overall very happy.",9,7,7,9,10,9,10
Graham (Alpha RLC),"Overall, Graham is really nice for its location, private bathrooms, and general cleanliness. Sometimes it can get loud when people invite their friends over. The common rooms though are rather lacking; the common room in my wing only has couches. Other common rooms have pool or ping-pong tables, but it feels rather random on what is in each room.",10,8,6,7,8,6,6
Casa Italiana (da Vinci RLC),"Overall, I've bee satisfied with my nearly two years at Casa. I appreciate the suite-style dorms, allowing me to share a bathroom with just 3 other suitemates and have a kitchen my second year (currently). Furnishings are standard. The bedrooms are quite small; each suite has an ample common room for all 8 residents. I would have preferred bigger bedrooms and smaller/no common room (e.g. like Graham suites).
The building overall is kept clean and safe, though it is a bit far from other campus buildings compared to other dorms. Amenities could be improved: laundry machines are present in quantity but not quality; stormy weather can cause the hot water to go out and hallway ceiling pipes to leak; the few common spaces are small and tucked away (except the lobby). 
The culture is not very strong, though admittedly, I didn't but much effort into engaging with it. CFs certainly hold events, but attendance is often low. Rooms are spread out and some hallways have twists and turns, meaning you don't interact with many people besides your suitemates. I'm okay with this, as it means the building is generally quiet.

Practically, Casa checks some nice boxes of being suite-style, providing amenities, and being a quiet and safe environment. That's why I'm satisfied with my experience despite some of its shortcomings.",5,7,8,7,9,4,4
Sanfilippo (Magis RLC),no ac or heat,9,8,7,6,10,6,9
Finn (Cura RLC),Lovely dorm building. No complaints whatsoever. The CFs were all very engaged with the community and had great events. The staff were amazing to interact with.,7,10,8,10,10,10,9
